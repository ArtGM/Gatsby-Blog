Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.

All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit!
